The way most developers get started contributing to a project.

## Building 

{project_name:} uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as its build tool. If you don't fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or [Download](download.html) a distribution or JAR.

### Prequisites

*Required:*
* Download and [install Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Get the latest [Source](source.html)
* Java 1.5

### Maven options

To build {project_name:} maven has to be configured to use more memory

    set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m

### A normal build

    mvn install

### Doing a Quick Build

The following avoids running all the unit test cases, we just skip the test running phase and not the building part

    mvn -Dtest=false clean install

### Using an IDE

If you prefer to use an IDE then you can auto-generate the IDE's project files using maven plugins. e.g.

    mvn eclipse:eclipse
  
or

    mvn idea:idea

### Importing into Eclipse

If you have not already done so, you will need to make Eclipse aware of the Maven repository so that it can build everything. In the preferences, go to `Java -> Build Path -> Classpath` and define a new Classpath Variable named `M2_REPO` that points to your local Maven repository. i.e. `~/.m2/repository` on Unix and `c:\Documents and Settings\$username\.m2\repository` on Windows).

You can also get Maven to do this for you:

    mvn eclipse:add-maven-repo -Declipse.workspace=/path/to/the/workspace/
